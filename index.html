      <div class="indent">John Fitzgerald Kennedy, known as JFK, was the 35th president of the United States of America. He was the youngest person to ever become the president till the end of his tenor in which he was assassinated.</div>
      <div class="indent">Born in the town of Brookline, Massachusetts, Kennedy was very well off. He went to the college of Harvard and graduated in 1940 after which he joined the U.S. Naval Reserves. His contributions in the Navy made him a war hero.</div>
      <div class="indent">After his military deeds left him severly injured he proceeded to get into politics and eventually led him to run for presidency in 1960. This was the first televised presidential election against Richard Nixon in which he narrowly won.</div>
      <div class="indent">One of his biggest achievements, I believe, was the U.S.'s introduction to the space race. The Apollo program was concieved during the Eisenhowers administration, but did not make too much progress. With Kennedy in office he pushed for the U.S to compete with the other countries to be the first one to land a crewed spacecraft on the moon. They finally got the funding for it but it wasn't till six years after his death that the Apollo 11 landed their first crewed spacecraft on the moon.

      <div class="indent">I found most of this information on 
        <a target="_blank" id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy">Wikipedia</a> and I know that wikipedia is not the most trustworthy site. However, Wikipedia has offered me very valuble information and I'm sure it will be very helpful in finding out more information about Kennedy</div>
